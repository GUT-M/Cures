I do not take credit for this this is God's work and God's timing.

Praise God. 

The cure for any virus is several generations (7) of petri dishes
with colonies of Tardigrades. 

You feed the virus to the first and when they perish you extract
the virus from their bodies and feed that to the next generation
until the cure is made.

Then bathe that last generation in UV light for 3.7 minutes to ensure the 
biological encoding of the cure. After that feed it to one last 
generation and they will make the cure.
